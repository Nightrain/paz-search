	/// <summary>
	/// Iterative mixed solvers. The mixed problem is
	/// <code>
	/// A q + B' u = f
	/// B q + C  u = g
	/// </code>
	/// <p>where <c>A</c> is symmetrical, positive definite. While a
	/// mixed problem can be formulated as a linear problem, a mixed
	/// solver can often be more efficient.</p>
	/// <p>The basic interface is <see cref="IMixedSolver"/> and there 
	/// are three implementations:</p>
	/// <ul>
	///		<li><see cref="UzawaSolver"/> - basic Uzawa algorithm, requires a steplength.</li>
	///		<li><see cref="GradientUzawaSolver"/> - Uzawa algorithm with gradient descent.</li>
	///		<li><see cref="CGUzawaSolver"/> - Uzawa algorithm using a conjugate gradient descent.</li>
	///	</ul>
	///	<p>The last method is often the fastest. All these use a solver for	the <c>A</c> matrix, 
	///	by default <see cref="MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Sparse.Linear.CGSolver"/> 
	///	is used, but different solvers can be set using <see cref="IMixedSolver.SubSolver"/>.</p>
