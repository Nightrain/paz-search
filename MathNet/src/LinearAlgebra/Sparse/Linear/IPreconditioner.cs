	/// Preconditioners are approximate solvers to some problem. They may be used
	/// in iterative solution procedures to speed up convergence.
	/// <p>
	/// The only method the user needs to call from this interface is setup.
	/// Before using the preconditioner in a LinearSolver, setup must have been
	/// called.
	/// The advantage of this is that the same internal structure of the
	/// preconditioner can be reused for repeated solves with the same matrix.
	/// This is particularly important for complicated preconditioners such as
	/// ILU or BlockDiagonalPreconditioner.
