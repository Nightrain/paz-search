#summary Rules for HR trigger.




= HR trigger =

  * The user inputs whether HR establishment will begin after a number of timesteps or a number of suitable sites visited by an animal
  * The user will also input the number of steps or sites needed to trigger this behavior
  * As animals move they should keep track of the end points of each time step as a possible home range center
  * If the trigger is based on steps, the animal should count the number of active steps it has taken
  * If the trigger is sites, the animal should count the number of suitable-unoccupied sites that it has visited (that were in that condition at time of most recent visit)
  * Once an animal has exceeded its trigger value it should choose a home range center
  * The animal should construct a list of all sites that were both suitable and unoccupied at the time of visiting them as well as being within a continuous area that was perceived by the animal that is greater than minimum HR size (i.e. take all sites and eliminate those that don’t qualify by clipping against memory map with only large enough suitable polygons included)
  * If no steps fit the criteria for a home range center (i.e. step vii results in empty list) the animal should continue searching and repeat steps iv – vii as necessary
  * The animal should then calculate the distance between its current location and each site
  * The animal will then assign a raw rank value for each site based on its [decision decision rule]
