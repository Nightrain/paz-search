#summary Describes correlated random walk of directed mover.



= Directed mover=

  * Number drawn from wrapped Cauchy distribution
  * Direction of movement = direction of HR center + number drawn
  * MVL of distribution based off polygon value for location of starting point and applicable modifiers
  * The boundary crossing and MVL distribution should be the same as the non-directed movement
